  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">Interactive quiz: How do you support balance?</h3>

  <!-- Scenario 1 -->
  <div style="padding:12px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>Scenario 1.</strong> You notice two colleagues regularly sending emails at 11 pm. Others in the team begin doing the same. What should you do?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>Set a clear norm.</strong> Say openly that out-of-hours emails do not need immediate replies, and use delayed send yourself. Make it clear that wellbeing and productivity are not measured by late-night activity.</p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <!-- Scenario 2 -->
  <div style="padding:12px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong> A major grant deadline falls just after the school summer holidays. You set an internal submission date for 31 August. Parents in the team are silent in the meeting. What should you do?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>Avoid pinch points.</strong> Move the internal date or allow staggered submissions. Deadlines that clash with school holidays disadvantage parents and carers and increase hidden overtime.</p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <!-- Scenario 3 -->
  <div style="padding:12px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>Scenario 3.</strong> At the end of a project meeting, staff leave without clarity on next steps. Later, people email at night because they are unsure what is expected. What should you do?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>Close with clarity.</strong> Always summarise next steps, roles, and timelines before finishing. This reduces rumination, supports detachment, and prevents late-night “just in case” work.</p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <!-- Scenario 4 -->
  <div style="padding:12px 0;border-top:1px solid #eee">
    <p><strong>Scenario 4.</strong> In one-to-ones, staff say they feel overwhelmed but still try to meet unrealistic timelines. What should you do?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Show answer</summary>
      <p><strong>Adjust workloads.</strong> Check deadlines, redistribute tasks, or cut scope where possible. Psychological safety and balance rely on leaders showing that workloads can be negotiated without penalty.</p>
